# Pyclient - A Python client for OpenAI compatible servers

A simple Python client packaged as a snap.
This snap is aimed to be able to connect as a consumer of an [inference snap](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/inference-snaps/)(note: this is a WIP see: https://github.com/canonical/qwen-vl-snap/pull/70).
